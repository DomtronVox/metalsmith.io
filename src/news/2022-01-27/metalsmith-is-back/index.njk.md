After a 5-year maintenance-mode break, Metalsmith.js is *back*. In a nutshell: the Metalsmith maintainers agreed to a transfer by Intellectual Property Assignment with [Segment][], &mdash; the previous owners & developers of Metalsmith. The software is now owned, maintained, and developed by [Kevin VL][webketje_gh] (me) doing business as [webketje][kbo], with periodic feedback from earlier maintainers [ismay][] and [Ajedi32][]. You can find more details about how Metalsmith got here on the [About page][].

## Who is the maintainer of metalsmith?

Hi! I am a Belgium-based IT-consultant specializing in front-end and Javascript/NodeJS, professionally active since late 2015 and active in open-source software development since 2014. I have a lot of experience with Node, NPM, SPA frameworks (React/Vue), DevOps, <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> and <abbr title="Developer Experience">DX</abbr> and stay current with the latest trends in the Javascript ecosystem. I am especially interested in the Headless CMS and static site generator trends.

I firmly believe in the value of open-source and free software, as it has enabled my current career path. I believe Metalsmith is a valuable piece of software that has a role to play in the future, and have been using it since 2018. I've contributed to or supported [Gitter][], [KnockoutJS][], [jstransformers][], [GetSimpleCMS][], [VLC media player][], [Linux Mint][], and many others by way of financial, code or support contributions, for example [on Stackoverflow][webketje_so].

## Metalsmith updates

* **Metalsmith org on Github & NPM** &mdash; We've decided to consolidate the previously fragmented *core plugins* in the GitHub [metalsmith org][metalsmith_gh] and [NPM @metalsmith org][metalsmith_npm] to increase the appeal and ease of introduction to the tool.
* **New core plugins** &mdash; [`@metalsmith/sass`](https://github.com/metalsmith/sass) - a dart-sass implementation, and [`@metalsmith/table-of-contents`](https://github.com/metalsmith/table-of-contents), adopted from the former community plugin [`metalsmith-autotoc`](https://github.com/anatoo/metalsmith-autotoc).
* **Metalsmith website redesign** &mdash; A responsive, multi-page website with a news, API, docs, and about section, all completely in metalsmith.
* **Added [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith/CONTRIBUTING.md)**
